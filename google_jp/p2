Problem description
You are given a tree-shaped undirected graph consisting of N nodes and N-1 edges (N is up to 50). For a node X in the tree, let d(X) be the distance (the number of edges) from X to its farthest node. Your task is to compute the minimum value of d(X) for the given tree.

The tree has the following properties:

It is connected.
It has no cycles.
For any pair of distinct nodes X and Y in the tree, there is exactly one path connecting X and Y.
Input
Test cases will be provided in the following multiline text format, using only ASCII characters. The first line contains one integer, C, which is the number of test cases that will follow. The second line is blank. From the third line onwards, the test cases separated by a blank line will follow. Each test case describes a tree and has the following format.

N
X1 Y1
X2 Y2
...
XN-1 YN-1
N is the number of nodes in the tree. Nodes are numbered 1 through N.

Xi Yi represents an undirected edge between nodes Xi and Yi. There are N - 1 edges.

Guarantees
All numbers in the input are integers.
Number of test cases: 1 <= C <= 100
Number of nodes: 2 <= N <= 50
Node IDs: 1 <= Xi <=N, 1 <= Yi <= N, Xi != Yi
The given graph is always a tree.
Note: You can assume that the input data is valid and satisfies all constraints. Your solution does not need to include error handling code.

Output
For each test case, output the result in the following format:

Case #k: R
where k is the index of the test case, starting from 1, and R is the minimum of d(X) for the given tree.

All tokens in the output should be separated by a single space.
